  My name is Karlo Martinez and I am a software engineer.

  Here you'll find out more about me and the projects that I have worked on. Some of the pasion project that I have are still being worked on, it is my hope that over time some of these might come into fruition. Also you'll see posts on what I am up to from time to time talking about my experiences and thoughts on popular items that interest me.
