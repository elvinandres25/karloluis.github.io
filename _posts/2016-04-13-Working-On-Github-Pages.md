Finally, having a personal page makes sense,
 now that I have my degree I feel accomplished and wanting to
 share my knowledge.
 Showcasing myself was never a priority whilst in college as
 studying would take the bulk of my time.
 I will be using the Github pages platform to experiment and
 polish my skills, share my thoughts, and maybe some other things
 that might interest me.
 I'll also talk about my ideas for different projects in depth,
 my experiences with software,
 and maybe some cool contributions in the Open Source community.
