# Working with Github Pages

Finally having a personal page makes sense,
 now that I have my degree I feel accomplished and wanting to
 share my knowledge.
 Showcasing myself was never a priority whilst in college as
 studies would take the bulk of my time.
 I'll be using the Github pages platform to experiment and
 polish my skills with html, css, and maybe some other things
 that might interest me in the process.
 I'll also talk about my ideas for different projects in depth,
 my experiences with software,
 and maybe some cool contributions in the Open Source community.
