# Intro
Computer Science and programming is becoming increasingly popular in Puerto Rico, the community is rapidly growing and we are starting to see a new generation of developers put to work. Although growth is fundamentally good, it reflects concern for the state of the industry itself

- concern over the current state of things

# Current market
When describing technology in Puerto Rico's professional landscape I jokingly respond with "it looks like the space-time continuum  was mended the wrong way. Small and medium businesses are managed as if it was the 80's running on the 90's infrastructure."

- relying outdated and greatly flawed software and hardware
- filled with passion and craving innovation
- flooding the job market, soon to be saturated
- the old giants
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft's ASP & .NET

# The startup idea
- defying the market standards where platform that are outdated and greatly flawed in comparison are the norm
- startups provide an opportunity to take innovation into our own hands and mold it to our will

- there are risks

- the new guy
  - nodejs


- things to look out for
Javascript is everywhere.
  - electron
  - mongo
  - react
  - meteor
